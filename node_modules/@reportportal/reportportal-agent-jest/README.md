# reportportal-agent-jest

A Jest reporter that uploads the results to a [ReportPortal](http://reportportal.io/) server.

## Installation

```shell
npm install --save-dev @reportportal/reportportal-agent-jest
```

## Usage
In your jest config section of `package.json`, add the following entry:
```JSON
{
    "jest": {
        ...
        "reporters": [
            "default",
            ["@reportportal/reportportal-agent-jest",
            {
                "endpoint": "https://your.reportportal.server/api/v1",
                "project": "YourReportPortalProjectName",
                "launchname": "YourLauncherName",
                "tags": ["tag1","tag2"]
            }]
        ],
        ...
    }
}
```

In case you use `jest.config.js`, you should add to it the following:

```javascript

module.exports = {
    ...
    reporters: [
        "default",
        [
            "@reportportal/reportportal-agent-jest",
            {
                "endpoint": "https://your.reportportal.server/api/v1",
                "project": "YourReportPortalProjectName",
                "launchname": "YourLauncherName",
                "tags": ["tag1","tag2"]
            }
        ]
    ]
    ...
```

It's possible by using environment variables, it's important to mention that environment variables has precedence over `package.json` definition.

```shell
$ export RP_TOKEN=XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX
$ export RP_PROJECT=MY_AWESOME_PROJECT
$ export RP_LAUNCH_NAME=MY_COOL_LAUNCHER
$ export RP_TAGS=tag1,tag2,tag3
```
This for your convenience in case you has a continuous job that run your tests and may post the results pointing to a different Report Portal definition of project, launcher name or tags.
